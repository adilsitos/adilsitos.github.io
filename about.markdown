  I am a software engineer currently working with critical web systems that 
  authenticate users. My main interests are distributed systems and 
  machine learning.  

  The personal projects I'm most proud of are the following, which you can find on my github:

  - A* algorithm to find the minimum path to solve the 8-puzzle problem: [A* 8-Puzzle](https://github.com/adilsitos/Astar-Algorithm-) 
  - A semantic search that recommends books according to a given description: [Amazon Semantic Search](https://github.com/adilsitos/Semantic-Search-Amazon-Data)
